# Sinusoidal Foot Trajectory for n-legged walking robot

For a 𝑛-legged walking robot, a foot trajectory was planned  to follow a sinusoidal trajectory (sinusoidal function wrt ground in the form of 𝑦 = 𝐴 ∙ 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜔𝑥) where is the vertical movement and 𝑥 is the horizontal movement). 

***Considered a foot average horizontal velocity of 0.16 𝑚/𝑠𝑒𝑐 with respect to the ground while the body moves with an average constant velocity of 0.04 𝑚/𝑠𝑒𝑐 with respect to the ground and a stride length of 0.16 𝑚 for the foot.** 

A cubic polynomial trajectory was considered for this.
